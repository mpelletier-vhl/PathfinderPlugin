Coming Soon:
- Better options page.
- Loading spinner? (Won't work, because fuck you, that's why)
- Styling

Bug: Cannot acquire characters from Preview page due to https security.
Bug: When one launches into loading characters, the browser seems to lock up. Does not allow me to add a Loading Spinner beforehand, either. This is annoying. I must find a workaround.
